 a. Develops, documents, and disseminates to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]:
   1. An access control policy that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management
     commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and
   2. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated access
     controls; and
 b. Reviews and updates the current:
   1. Access control policy [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]; and
   2. Access control procedures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].

Supplemental Guidance: This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
 effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AC family.
 Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations,
 policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level
 may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included
 as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented
 by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be
 established for the security program in general and for particular information systems, if needed.

The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.
Related control: PM-9.
Control Enhancements: None.
